``//TODO``

Old Bots to test against.

#### Bot F

This bot was testing a mocking strategy where the reward was partially based 
on how its actions were similar to an 'expert bot'.

#### Bot E

##### µ = 36.8

A non-ML bot that simply sends ships to/from areas of high halite concentration.

#### Bot D

I found this bot within the halite tools directory so I'm using it simply to test against.

#### Bot C

A refined version of ``Bot B`` with more parameters and more detail.

#### Bot B

##### µ = 31.9

Trying out an RL agent with basic game parameters as input and a discrete action as output
with the reward proportional to the halite gained each move.

#### Bot A

##### µ = 22.4

Randomly pick all actions, pretty much just the starter bot.
